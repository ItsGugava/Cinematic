# Cinematic
This is an ASP.NET Core Web API project for a movie website. The API allows users to interact with movies, including functionalities such as commenting on movies, adding movies to favorites, and managing user accounts. There is also an Admin role with elevated permissions to manage movies (add, update, delete). This project uses SQL Server as the database to store and manage all the important data.
